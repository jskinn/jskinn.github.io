Each post is a file in the `_posts` directory.
To rebuild the site, run
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. 

## Markdown

Posts are written in markdown, using a parser called kramdown.
The quick reference for kramdown is here: [https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html]
